This project is to demonstrate an understanding of importing external packages(numpy) and using loops, ranges, and conditionals to run a range through a mathematical process. To extend the project further, I also turned the fizz and buzz values into variables as well, increasing the inputs from 1 to 3. Instead of only the max value of the range, you also input the fizz value, the buzz value, and calculates the fizzbuzz value.
